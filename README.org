* derui's Emacs Configurations
My emacs configuration since 2013.

* Features

- Aims for a fast launch time, achieving approximately 150ms.
- Provide wide range packages for usability.
  - Writing, development, and more. But I don't use Emacs as *for all* , so this config do not contain email client, slack client, and some 3rd party clients. 
- Strive for maximum replicability using =elpaca=.
- Optimized for early Emacs versions (e.g., 31.0.50 for daily use).
- Includes support for Japanese input methods.
- This configuration can run on Linux and macOS.
  - I'm living Linux for daily, but I'm working on macOS.

* Install
Clone this repository to =$XDG_CONFIG_DIR//emacs= . This repository keeps as clean as possible user's emacs directory. Use =$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/emacs-local= for user-related state and configurations.

* Configuration
My config will load =user-env.el= on early stage of launching. It is the best place to set some options.

* Develop
You need [[https://taskfile.dev/][Taskfile]] to build init.el/early-init.el in your environment.

#+begin_src shell
  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/
  $ git clone https://github.com/derui/dot.emacs.d ~/.config/emacs
  $ cd ~/.config/emacs
  # Tangle early-init.el and init.el.
  $ task tangle
#+end_src

Notice, I've decided to not to compile ~init.el~ . It is not recommended by official document, but it is only used to launch time. Some macros defined in init.el are tiny and simple, so no worry about that.
