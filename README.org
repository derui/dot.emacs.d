* derui's Emacs Configurations
My emacs configuration since 2013.

  - I use 31.0.50 for daily work
- For japanese
  - I'm japanese, so defines some input methods
- Run on Linux, and macOS
  - I'm on Linux daily, but works on macOS.


* Install
Clone this repository to ~~/.config/emacs~ . This repository keeps as possible as clean your user-emacs directory. Use ~$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/emacs-local~ for user-related state and configurations.

* Develop
You need [[https://taskfile.dev/][task]] to get init.el/early-init.el for your environment.

#+begin_src shell
  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/
  $ git clone https://github.com/derui/dot.emacs.d ~/.config/emacs
  $ cd ~/.config/emacs
  # Tangle early-init.el and init.el, and compile those.
  $ task
#+end_src
