* derui's Emacs Configurations
My emacs configuration since 2013.

* Features

- Aims for a fast launch time, achieving approximately 150ms.
- Strive for maximum replicability using ~elpaca~.
- Optimized for early Emacs versions (e.g., 31.0.50 for daily use).
- Includes support for Japanese input methods.
- Runs on both Linux and macOS.
  - I'm using Linux for daily, but I'm working on macOS.

* Install
Clone this repository to ~\~/.config/emacs~ . This repository keeps as clean as possible user's emacs directory. Use ~$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/emacs-local~ for user-related state and configurations.

* Develop
You need [[https://just.systems/man/en/introduction.html][just]] to get init.el/early-init.el for your environment.

#+begin_src shell
  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/
  $ git clone https://github.com/derui/dot.emacs.d ~/.config/emacs
  $ cd ~/.config/emacs
  # Tangle early-init.el and init.el.
  $ just tangle
#+end_src

Notice, I've decided to not to compile ~init.el~ . It is not recommended by official document, and is only used to launch time.
